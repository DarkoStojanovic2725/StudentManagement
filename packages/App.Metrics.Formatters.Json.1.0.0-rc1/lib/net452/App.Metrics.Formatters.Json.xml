                    Counter metric types track how many times something happens, they can incremented or decremented.

                    Counters provide the ability to track a counter for each item in a finite set, as well as tracking a per item
                    count the overall percentage is also recorded. This is useful for example if we needed to track the total
                    number of emails sent but also the count of each type of emails sent.

                <para>
                    Histogram metric types track the statistical distribution of a set of values. They allow you to measure the
                    min, mean, max, standard deviation of values and also quantiles such as the median, 95th percentile, 98th
                    percentile etc.
                </para>
                <para>
                    To avoid unbound memory usage, the histogram values are genreated from a <see cref="T:App.Metrics.Abstractions.ReservoirSampling.IReservoir" /> of values.
                    This is done by sampling the data as it goes through by maintaining a small manageable  reservoir which is
                    statistically representative of the data stream as a whole, allowing us to quickly calculate the quantiles
                    which are valid approximations of the actual quantiles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling

                    Histograms also allow us to track user values, where for all user values provided the min, max and last user
                    value values is recorded.

            <summary>
                <para>
                    Meter metric types are increment-only counters that also measure the rate of events over time.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The mean rate is recorded, but is only generally used for trivia as it represents the total rate for the
                    lifetime of your application, not offering a sense of recency.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Other than the mean rate, meters also are recorded using three different exponentially-weighted moving average
                    rates, 1 min, 5 min and 15 min moving averages which do provide a sense of recency.

            <summary>
                MetricsContext's are a way of grouping metrics withing a context, for example we can record all database related
                metrics in a "Application.Database" Context. Metric names can be duplicated across contexts

                    As well as providing a <see cref="P:App.Metrics.Formatters.Json.TimerMetric.Histogram" /> of the duration of a type of event, timers also provide a
